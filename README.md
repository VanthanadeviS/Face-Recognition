# Face-Recognition
The problem statement of the face recognition project revolves around the need to develop a system capable of identifying and recognizing faces in real-time video streams. Face recognition involves automatically identifying or verifying a person's identity from digital images or video frames. This technology has a wide range of applications, including security systems, access control, surveillance, user authentication, and personalized user experiences.

The primary objective is to build a system that can perform the following tasks:

1. **Detection**: Detect faces in video frames captured from a webcam. This involves identifying regions in the image that likely contain human faces.

2. **Recognition**: Recognize the identities of detected faces by comparing them against a database of known individuals. Each face is matched with its corresponding identity based on pre-stored facial features or encodings.

3. **Real-time Processing**: Perform face detection and recognition in real-time, allowing the system to process video streams with minimal delay.

4. **Accuracy and Robustness**: Ensure that the face recognition system achieves high accuracy and robustness, even under varying lighting conditions, facial expressions, poses, and occlusions.

5. **User Interface**: Provide a user-friendly interface for displaying the live video stream along with recognized faces and their identities. This interface should allow users to interact with the system easily.

6. **Error Handling**: Implement mechanisms for handling errors gracefully, such as when a face cannot be detected or recognized accurately. This may involve providing feedback to the user or logging error messages for further analysis.

By addressing these objectives, the face recognition system aims to provide an effective and reliable solution for identifying individuals in real-time video streams, with potential applications in security, surveillance, authentication, and personalized services.
